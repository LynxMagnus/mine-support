        Given I open the url "/"

        Then  I wait on element ".govuk-button--start" for 500ms to be displayed
        When I click on the button ".govuk-button--start"
        Then I expect that the url contains "/claim/name"
        Then  I wait on element "#name" for 500ms to be displayed
        And I clear the inputfield "#name"
        And I click on the button "#name"
        And I add "Seymour Pattisson" to the inputfield "#name"
        When I click on the button "#submit"
        And   I pause for 500ms
